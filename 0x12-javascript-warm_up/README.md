# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

1. Scripting (same as we did with Python)
2. Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

## Learning Objectives

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing?
  - The go to language for web
  - Client-Side Scripting, Asynchronous Programming, DOM Manipulation
  - Cross-Platform Compatibility, Libraries and Frameworks
  - Prototype-Based Inheritance
  - And much more
- How to run a JavaScript script?
  - By adding the src of the JS file to HTML File
  - Or at the terminal by doing the following
    - `#!/usr/bin/node` adding as the first line of the script
    - Allow executing
- How to create variables and constants?
  - var, let, const
- What are differences between var, const and let?
  - var: globally hoisted const and let are not
  - var: lexically scoped var and let are block scoped
  - var is older than let, const but not recommended to use nowadays
  - var and let can be reassigned const cannot
- What are all the data types available in JavaScript?
  - String, Number, Boolean, Objects, Null, NaN, Undefined, Sybols
- How to use the if, if ... else statements?
  - `if (condition){code block} else if (condition){code block} else {code block}`
- How to use comments?
  - By adding `// comments` if a single line comment or `/* comments */` if a multible lines comments
- How to affect values to variables?
  - `var/let/const varName = value`
- How to use while and for loops?
  - `while(condition is true){keep doing this code block}`
- How to use break and continue statements?
  - `break` gets us out of the loop immediately
  - `continue` skips the current iteration to the next one
- What is a function and how do you use functions?
  - a block of code can be reused (maybe not IIFE).
  - get assigned to a name and might accepts parameters.
  - gets defined as a normal variable with a name.
- What does a function that does not use any return statement return?
  - `undefined`
- Scope of variables?
  - Global scope
  - Block Scope
  - Function Scope (ES6+)
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them?
  - +, -, /, \*, %, ++, --
  - Perform arithmetic operations to varibales or literal values
- How to manipulate dictionary?
  - `objName.keyToAddOrChange = theValue`
- How to import a file?
  - we use `const moduleName = require('fileName');` to export
  - we use `import * as moduleName from 'fileName';` to import
